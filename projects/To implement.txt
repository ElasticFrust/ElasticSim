In order to solve - 
Create another mesh/geomtry object (probably geometry) that inherits base_geometry_interface and adds and object / property  "ENRERGY" and "ENERGEY GRADIENT"
	+ name siggestion: elasti_geometry / elastic_membrane
	+ new properties
		- strain 
		- stress 
		- reference metric (initiallization) [field]
		- Elastic tensor (Young's modulus, Poisson ratio [field]
	+ Including a way to define constraints (typically fices positions but not necessarily)

Implement a static solver that advances the solution
